q.1.A vending machine only accepts coins of 10, 5, and 1 rupees. Write a program that takes any amount X and returns the fewest number of coins needed to make the amount.



#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int amount;
    cout <<"Enter the amount in rupees for coin : ";
    cin>>amount;
    int coinsof10=amount/10;
    amount%=10;                
    int coinsof5=amount/5;
    amount%=5;                
    int coinsof1=amount;
    int totalcoins=coinsof10+coinsof5+coinsof1;
    cout<<"Minimum number of coins required: "<<totalcoins<<"\n";
    cout<<"Coins used: "<<coinsof10<<" (10 rupee), "<<coinsof5<<" (5 rupee),"<<coinsof1<<" (1 rupee)"<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
output:-
Enter the amount in rupees for coin : 199
Minimum number of coins required: 24
Coins used: 19 (10 rupee), 1 (5 rupee),4 (1 rupee)

q.2.A person wants to save a total of X rupees by depositing an amount that doubles every day, starting from 1 rupee. Write a program to find out how many days it will take to save at least X rupees.



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int x;
    cout<<"Enter the total amount you want to save in rupees : ";
    cin >> x;
    int totalamount=0;
    int dailyamount=1;
    int days=0;
    while(totalamount<x) 
    {
        totalamount+=dailyamount;
        dailyamount*=2;
        days++;
    }
    cout<<"It will take "<<days<<" days to save "<<x<<" rupees . "<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
output:-
Enter the total amount you want to save in rupees : 100
It will take 7 days to save 100 rupees .

q.3.You have N chocolates, and you want to distribute them among M children. Each child must get at least 1 chocolate. Distribute the chocolates in a way that the difference between the child who gets the most chocolates and the child who gets the fewest is minimized. Write a loop-based solution to distribute the chocolates.



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int totalchocolates,numberofchildren;
    cout<<"Enter the number of chocolates: ";
    cin>>totalchocolates;
    cout<<"Enter the number of children: ";
    cin>>numberofchildren;
    if (numberofchildren>totalchocolates)
    {
        cout <<"Not enough chocolates " <<"\n";
        return 0;
    }
    vector<int>chocolates(numberofchildren, 1);
    totalchocolates-=numberofchildren;
    for (int i=0;totalchocolates>0;i=(i+1)%numberofchildren) 
    {
        chocolates[i]++;
        totalchocolates--;
    }
    cout<<"Distribution of chocolates among children:"<<"\n";
    for (int i = 0; i <numberofchildren; i++) 
    {
        cout<<"Child "<<(i+1)<<": "<<chocolates[i]<<" chocolates"<<"\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
output:-
Enter the number of chocolates: 5
Enter the number of children: 4
Distribution of chocolates among children:
Child 1: 2 chocolates
Child 2: 1 chocolates
Child 3: 1 chocolates
Child 4: 1 chocolates
====================================================================================================================================
q.4.A person runs N kilometers every day, but their speed decreases by 10% every day. Write a program that calculates how many days it will take for the personâ€™s daily distance to be less than K kilometers.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    double N, K;
    cout << "Enter the initial distance in kilometers the person runs daily: ";
    cin >> N;
    cout << "Enter the minimum distance in kilometers threshold: ";
    cin >> K;
    int days = 0;
    while (N >= K)
    {
        days++;
        N=N*0.9;
    }
    cout<<"It will take "<<days<<" days for the daily distance to be less than "<<K<<" kilometers."<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
output:-
Enter the initial distance in kilometers the person runs daily: 110
Enter the minimum distance in kilometers threshold: 10
It will take 23 days for the daily distance to be less than 10 kilometers.
====================================================================================================================================
q.5.Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number N using loops, but the twist is that the program should skip calculating the factorial for all numbers divisible by 3.



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int N;
    cout << "Enter a number to calculate it's factorial: ";
    cin >> N;
    long long factorial = 1;
    for (int i=1;i<=N;i++) 
    {
        if (i % 3 == 0) 
        {
            break;
        }
        factorial *= i;
    }
    cout<<"Factorial of "<<N<<" skipping multiples of 3 is: "<<factorial<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
output:-
Enter a number to calculate it's factorial: 6
Factorial of 6 skipping multiples of 3 is: 2

q.6.A shop sells books, where each book costs either 120, 50, or 20 rupees. For a given amount X, use loops to find how many books the person can buy with an exact match of the amount using any combination of these prices.



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int X;
    cout<<"Enter the total amount in rupees: ";
    cin>>X;
    int maxBooks = 0;
    for (int count120=0;count120<=X/120;count120++) 
    {
        for (int count50=0;count50<=(X-count120*120)/50;count50++) 
        {
            int remainingAmount=X-(count120*120+count50*50);
            if (remainingAmount%20==0)
            {
                int count20=remainingAmount/20;
                int totalBooks = count120 + count50 + count20;
                if (totalBooks > maxBooks) 
                {
                    maxBooks = totalBooks;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "Maximum number of books you can buy: "<<maxBooks<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
output:-
Enter the total amount in rupees: 1090
Maximum number of books you can buy: 53

q.1: Access Control
You are developing a simple login system. Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a username
and password. If both the username and password match predefined values, grant access.
Otherwise, deny access.........



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string dbemail="sonipushpendra256@gmail.com",dbpassword="0206";
    string email,password;
    cout<<"enter your email: \n";
    cin>>email;
    cout<<"enter your password: \n";
    cin>>password;
    if(email!=dbemail || password!=dbpassword)
    {
        cout<<"Access denied! Invalid username or password. \n";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"Access granted! \n";
    }
    int maxAttempts = 3;
    int attempts = 0;
    string username, correctUsername = "sonipushpendra256@gmail.com", correctPassword = "0206";
    while (attempts < maxAttempts) 
    {
        cout << "Enter username: ";
        cin >> username;
        cout << "Enter password: ";
        cin >> password;
        if (username == correctUsername && password == correctPassword)
        {
            cout <<"Login successful. Welcome, " <<username <<"!" <<"\n";
            break;
        }
        else 
        {
            cout <<"Access denied! Invalid username or password. Please try again.\n";
            attempts++;
        }
    }
    if (attempts == maxAttempts) 
    {
        cout << "Maximum login attempts reached. Access denied.\n";
    }
    char choice;
    string newUsername, newPassword;
    cout<<"Do you want to create a new ID and password? (y/n): ";
    cin>>choice;

    if (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y') 
    {
        cout<<"Enter new username: ";
        cin>>newUsername;
        cout<<"Enter new password: ";
        cin>>newPassword;
        cout<<"New ID and password created successfully!" << endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"sure if you don't want to make new i'd or password. this is your choice. thank you.\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
